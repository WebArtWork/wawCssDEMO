If you have Angular Component which is used on multiple pages, this is the place to hold it.
To generate new multiple component you can use:
waw generate multiple NAME
waw g m NAME
waw gm NAME
In case of complex multiple component where you will need sub components, you can use:
waw generate multiplecomponent MULTINAME/NAME
waw g mc MULTINAME/NAME
waw gmc MULTINAME/NAME
which will create new sub component for specified multiple component.
